          I am a `Fullstack React Developer`, meaning I am able to develop
          `React` on the server with `React Server Components (RSC)`.

          I have developed an implementation of `React Server Components (RSC)`.
          Can be used with `npx create-rsc-app@latest my-app` for the setup
          without `SSR (Server Side Rendering)` and with `npx
          create-rsc-app@latest my-app --ssr` for the setup with `SSR`.
        </RM>
        <RM>
          I love `React` and web development in general. I have also experience
          with `React Native` (I've developed and published an app with it named
          `mygroupsapp`).
        </RM>
        <RM>
          I have also developed a library for state management in `React` (and
          `React Native`) named `react-context-slices`. It seamlessly integrates
          both `Redux` and `React Context` with zero-boilerplate. I've made a
          dedicated site to it: click
          **[here](https://react-context-slices.github.io)** to see.

          I have also made a dedicated site for `The RSC Setup` I've made, can
          be seen **[here](https://rsc-setup.netlify.app)**.
